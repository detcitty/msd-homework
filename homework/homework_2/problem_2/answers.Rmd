```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```

Read data

```{r}
data <- read_tsv('polyfit.tsv')
```

shuffle the data and assign each row to one of 5 different folds
make sure to use this seed
```{r}
set.seed(4990)

```


```{r}
data

```

```{r}
names(data)
```



```{r}
plot(data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```


implement 5-fold cross-validation to compute the average train / test error (RMSE) for each polynomial degree
```{r}

```

make a plot showing the how the train and test error vary with the polynomial degree
```{r}

```


select the degree with the lowest average test error
```{r}

```

fit a final model for this degree on all of the data
```{r}

```


make a scatter plot of all of the data with the best-fit model overlayed as a line
```{r}

```

report the coefficients for the best-fit model
```{r}

```
